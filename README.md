# flow-meter

This is a proof-of-concept for interacting with a liquid flow meter. I used this one from Adafruit for testing: https://www.adafruit.com/products/828.

Maven is used to build the application. Once built, it can be transferred to the Raspberry Pi and run with Java like this:
```
sudo java -jar flow-meter-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
